      "reflection": "It takes great faith to believe that Jesus rose from the dead and that we, too, shall rise.  As Jesus told his apostles, \"Blessed are that who have not seen, and yet believe.\" This mystery offers us help in maintaining that faith.  \"Lord, I believe.  Please help my unbelief!\""

      "reflection": "The disciples were scared.  They huddled together in that upper room not sure of what to do.  Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon them and they were ready to go out and give their very lives in service to God.  May the Holy Spirit also grant us that wisdom and love of God."

      "fruit": "Humility",
      "name": "Annunciation",
      "reflection": "It is appropriate to begin the rosary with the virtue of humility. The _Catechism of the Catholic Church_ states that \"humility is the foundation of prayer. Only when we humbly acknowledge that 'we do not know how to pray as we ought,' are we ready to receive freely the gift of prayer. 'Man is a beggar before God.'\" (CCC 2559)"

      "fruit": "Obedience",
      "name": "Presentation",
      "reflection": "Mary and Joseph humbly brought Jesus to the temple in accord with Jewish law. Obedience to God and to others can be very difficult, but offers us the opportunity to subjugate our own will to that of our heavenly Father. Not my will, but God's will be done."

      "name": "Finding of the Child Jesus in the Temple",
      "reflection": "Piety is dedication to the Church's sacramental life and devotions. Mary and Joseph were surprised to find Jesus in the temple. We, too, should be dedicated to our Church and the sacraments."

      "reflection": "Mary encouraged her Son to perform his first miracle at the Wedding at Cana. She simply told the servants to \"do whatever he tells you.\" She helps us in a similar way — always pointing us to her Son and interceding on our behalf. We need only to turn to her and ask for help."

We need to be so thankful for that gift.  At the same time, when we are asked to die to ourselves and put others first, we can look to the cross for the example of total self-giving."
